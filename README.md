#Lightalarm

My first microcontroller project

An esp32 connected to TEA5767 and 64x32 led matrix.

My goal is to build a alarm clock that can be configured via a webpage. The alarm should be in the form of a radio starting to play with increasing volume and the led matrix to simulate a sunrise. Outside of operation, the esp should go into deepsleep and when awake, show some infos (date, time, weather...) on the led matrix.
